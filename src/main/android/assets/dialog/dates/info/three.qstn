message = I was trying to find out when Spring break was, however, I was not able to log on to the udel registrar website to view the academic calendar.  I tried looking for my UD student guide to University Policies, but i couln't find it.  Thankfully, I went to my college's academic advisement office, and they showed me the academic calendar! 
notes = Students can access the academic calendar in many locations.
